# Optimize Marketing Strategy:KPMG Virtual Internship project

## Objective:
* Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team.

* Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space (you can read more here). In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

* Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

* However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

1. Customer Demographic
2. Customer Addresses
3. Transactions data in the past 3 months

## Data Quality Assessment
Here the objective was to draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. A data quality framework was also given

So necessary petroling was done in the dataset and a letter was drafted

## Data Insights
Now we started to dive deep into the dataset. we need to start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

* ### Data exploration 
It is to familarize with the data, know the charactristics and find intial patterns hidden within it.

* ### Data model Development 
Here we segragate and indentify the customers according to their transcations done with the company. Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model was implemented. which classify customers according to how recent they purchase with the company, how frequent do they purchase, and how much revenue was company able to generate.
### RFM Analysis
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank, to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns.
