# Optimize Marketing Strategy: KPMG Virtual Internship project

## Objective:
* Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-size bikes & cycling accessories organization, is a long-standing KPMG client who specializes in high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories to riders. Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analyzing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behavior. The Marketing Manager has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team.

* Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space (you can read more here). In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyze the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

* Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organization has a large dataset relating to its customers, but its team is unsure how to effectively analyze it to help optimize its marketing strategy.

* However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas, and she advised that “the importance of optimizing the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it to drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

1. Customer Demographic
2. Customer Addresses
3. Transaction’s data in the past 3 months

## Data Quality Assessment
Here the objective was to draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. A data quality framework was also given

So necessary petroling was done in the dataset and a letter was drafted

## Data Insights
Now we started to dive deep into the dataset. we need to start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.Click [here](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Faru20%2FOptimize-Marketing-Strategy%2Fmain%2FSprocket_CentalPvtLTD-Data%2520insight.pptx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) to know more about Sprocket_CentalPvtLTD-Data insight.

Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model was implemented. which classify customers according to how recent they purchase with the company, how frequent do they purchase, and how much revenue was company able to generate.
